Everlysn is a web application that helps users explore music and find new recommendations. It is built off of Spotify's API and it gives users an essentially infinite source of new recommendations.

The app has two main features:
1. Basic data visualization allowing users to see a graphic representation of various song attribute designated by Spotify (e.g. tempo, energy, danceability)
2. A faceted search for finding related tracks. Starting with a given track, the user can select certain attributes that they would like to see prioritized in their serach for related tracks.
